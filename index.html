			Have you ever experienced one of the following:
			<ul>
			<li>Explorer hangs when UAC is loading after I tried to run certain EXE that required administrator privileges.
			<li>UAC pops out and asks me did I want to allow the program to run... when I start a program that I'm already familiar.
			<li>Unable to run a program with elevated privileges in command line.
