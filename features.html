	QuickAdmin supports any operating system that implements UAC, such as Windows Vista and later operating system. It works under 32bit and 64bit OS.<p>
	Highlight features:<p>
	1) Elevated Shortcut just works like the one you get used with<br>
	<div class="text indent">
	Elevated Shortcut still works after you reinstalled Windows. It accepts files and folders dropped on it. It can be pinned to Taskbar and Start Menu by drag and drop. It just works like a shortcut file you get used with.

	2) It is very fast and small<br>
	<div class="text indent">
	QuickAdmin is developed and tested on a netbook, yet it performs well. Its executer is written with VBS, which starts within a second. As of version 3.6, the executable file only occupies 117KB!
	</div><p>
	3) No negative impact on performance, even on Netbook<br>
	<div class="text indent">

	</div><p>
	4) No additional installation needed<br>
	<div class="text indent">
	QuickAdmin uses .NET Framework 2.0, which is already included in Windows Vista and 7. Unlike other .NET applications, it is compatible with .NET Framework 4.0 too, which is included in Windows 8 and later version of Windows. Thus, it runs natively on every version of Windows it supports!<br>

	<div class="text indent">
	I as the developer of QuickAdmin has been using it since years ago, and has been updating it from time to time. As of v3.6, I can say it is very stable. However, program does have bug, developers know it, so if you find one, please feel free to <a href="contactme.html">tell me</a>.
